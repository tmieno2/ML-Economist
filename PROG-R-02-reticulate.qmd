# Running Python from R

There are many Python packages that implement machine learning methods that are not available in R at the moment. Fortunately for R users, we can easily call Python functions from within R to take advantage of those Python packages. In this chapter, we learn how to do so using the `reticulate` package. Its [package website](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) is very helpful and cover more topics than this chapter does.

We will run mainly the following python codes in different ways on R.

```{python}
#| eval: false
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import numpy as np

#=== set parameters for data generation ===#
n_samples, n_features, n_informative, noise = 2000, 20, 15, 2
rng = np.random.RandomState(8934)

#=== generate synthetic data ===#
X, y = make_regression(
  n_samples, 
  n_features, 
  n_informative = n_informative, 
  noise = noise, 
  random_state = rng
)

#=== split to test and train data ===#
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, random_state = rng
)

#=== set up an RF ===#
reg_rf = RandomForestRegressor(max_features = "sqrt")

#=== train an RF on the train data ===#
reg_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

#=== test the fit ===#
reg_rf.score(X_test, y_test)
```

**Packages to load for replications**

library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Set up a Python virtual environment

It is recommended that you have a python virtual environment (VE) specific for each of your projects. A VE is independent of the rest of the Python environment on your computer and avoid breaking codes from your old projects that may depend on a specific versions of Python packages. It also made it easier for others to replicate your work.

Let's first load the `reticulate` package.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

For inexperienced Python users, the `reticulate` package offers an easy way to set up and manage a Python VE. First, you can create a VE using `virtualenv_create()`. The following code for example create a VE called 
**ml-learning**.

```{r}
#| eval: false 
virtualenv_create("ml-learning")
```

The newly created VE have only minimal packages. Here is the list of packages I have in this new VE.  

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figures/pacakges.png")
```

This is despite all the packages that I have installed in my main Python installation. 

You can install packages to a VE using `virtualenv_install()`. For example, the code below attempts to install the `econml` package to the VE called **ml-learning**.

```{r}
#| eval: false 
virtualenv_install("ml-learning", "econml")
```

In order to use a VE, you use `use_virtualenv()` after you load the `reticulate` package.

```{r}
#| eval: false 
use_virtualenv("ml-learning")
``` 

After this, all your python codes will be run on the VE when you are running them through the `reticulate` package. We will now look at how we actually run Python codes from R.

## R and Python REPL simultaneously {#sec-r-python-repl}

::: {.column-margin}
RPEL stands for read-evaluate-print-loop.
:::

Within your R session, you can start a Python session that is embedded in it by running `repl_python()` from R. This will allow you to go back and forth between R and Python. Objects created in Python can be accessed from R using the `py` object as described above. This provides an ideal environment where you can test the interactions of your R and Python codes in a seamless manner. 

You initiate a Python environment using `repl_python()`. If you are using RStudio, this is what it looks like. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
repl_python()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figures/repl_python.png")
```

As you can see on the console tab, a python session has been initiated, which is connected your R session. As long as you are using RStudio, you do not have to worry about switching between R and Python manually. RStudio is smart enough to know where the codes are coming from and execute codes where they should be executed. That is, if you run codes from a python (R) file, they will be sent to the python (R) console. 

Picture below shows what the console looks like after I executed `library(data.table)` while I am still on the python console. You can see `>>> quit` (exit from python) before `library(data.table)` was executed on R. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figures/python_repl_to_R_automatic.png")
```

Let's now define an object called `a` in python.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figures/python_a.png")
```

:::{.callout-tip}
From R, you can access objects defined on Python by using `py$` prefix to the object name on python. This is like you are accessing an element of a list on R. `py` has a list of objects defined on Python.
:::

Let's now confirm this by accessing `a` on R.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_a.png")
```

:::{.callout-tip}
When you access R objects in Python, you can use `r.` in front of the object name. We first run `b <- 1:10` and then confirm `r.b` can get you the Python equivalent of `b` in R.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figures/python_b.png")
```

Great. This seamless integration is really nice especially when you are writing an R-centric program that include pythons codes and are tying to debug.

Whenever R and Python exchange objects, they are automatically converted to their counterparts in the receiving program. For example, a vector with multiple elements in R will be converted to a list in Python, and vice versa. See [here](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) for more examples.

## Importing Python modules

You can import Python modules and use them as if they are R functions. This way of interacting with Python involves the least direct interactions with Python among all the options that the `reticulate` package provides us with. Unlike the approach above (@sec-r-python-repl), you do not see outcomes of your Python codes on the Python console. Rather, you will see the outcomes translated to R object on R. 

You can import a python module using `import()` like below, which imports the Python `os` package.

```{r}
(
os <- import("os")
)
```

The imported module is assigned to `os` on R. You can access functions in a module using `$` instead of `.` as done in Python.

For example, the following code use `listdir()` from the `os` module.

```{r}
os$listdir(".") %>% head()
```

Let's rewrite the above sample Python code using this method. First, we import all the modules (not the functions) we need.

```{r}
sk_ds <- import("sklearn.datasets")
sk_ms <- import("sklearn.model_selection")
sk_ensemble <- import("sklearn.ensemble")
np <- import("numpy")
```

If you try this, you will get a complaint. 

```{r}
#| error: true
make_regression <- import("sklearn.datasets.make_regression")
```

Now, let's define parameters used in `make_regression()`.

```{r}
n_samples <- as.integer(2000)
n_features <- as.integer(20)
n_informative <- as.integer(15)
noise <- 2
rng <- np$random$RandomState(as.integer(123))
```

Note that the values of `n_sample`, `n_features`, and `n_informative` are made integers explicitly. This is because Python accepts only integers for those parameters (see [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_regression.html)). `noise` is a float and you can be loose about what type of numeric value you provide.

Now, in the Python code below, `make_regression` create a tuple (like a list on R) of tuple of length 2: the first one is an array of 2000 by 20 (assigned to `X`) and the second one is an array of 2000 by 1 (assigned to `y`). Python has a convenient way of assigning the elements of a tuple to new objects as shown below. 

```{python}
#| eval: false 
X, y = make_regression(
  n_samples, 
  n_features, 
  n_informative = n_informative, 
  noise = noise, 
  random_state = rng
)
```

R is a bit clumsy on this. So, we can just assign the list of arrays into a single object as a list like below and then extract its elements separately later.  

```{r}
synth_data <-
  sk_ds$make_regression(
    n_samples, 
    n_features, 
    n_informative = n_informative, 
    noise = noise, 
    random_state = rng
  )
```

Here is the structure of the data created.

```{r}
str(synth_data)
```

We can then generate $X$ and $y$ like below.

```{r}
X <- synth_data[[1]]
y <- synth_data[[2]]
```

We now split the dataset into the train and test datasets using `train_test_split()`.

```{r}
train_test_ls <- sk_ms$train_test_split(X, y, random_state = rng)
```

Assign each element of `train_test_ls` to R objects with appropriate names.

```{r}
X_train <- train_test_ls[[1]]
X_test <- train_test_ls[[2]]
y_train <- train_test_ls[[3]]
y_test <- train_test_ls[[4]]
```

Then, train RF on the train data, and then test the fit.

```{r}
#=== set up an RF ===#
reg_rf <- sk_ensemble$RandomForestRegressor(max_features = "sqrt")

#=== train an RF on the train data ===#
reg_rf$fit(X_train, y_train)

#=== test the fit ===#
reg_rf$score(X_test, y_test)
```

## Sourcing Python scripts

Another way to run Python codes from R is to source a python script to make python functions and modules available.

Here is the Python code in the file called `import_modules.py`.

```{python}
# | eval: false

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import numpy
```

You can source this file using `source_python()`.

```{r}
source_python("import_modules.py")
```

::: {.column-margin}
`import_modules.py` is included in [the github repository](https://github.com/tmieno2/ML-Economist).
:::

The first three lines are importing functions (`train_test_split`, `make_regression`, and `RandomForestRegressor`), while the last line is importing a module (`numpy`).  When functions are imported in this manner, they can be used without `py$` as if they are R functions.

```{r}
synth_data <-
  make_regression(
    n_samples, 
    n_features, 
    n_informative = n_informative, 
    noise = noise, 
    random_state = rng
  )

length(synth_data)
```

However, a module imported in this manner cannot be used without `py$`. So, you cannot do this. 

```{r}
#| error: true
numpy$random$RandomState(as.integer(123))
```

Rather, you need to do this:

```{r}
py$numpy$random$RandomState(as.integer(123))
```

You can source user-defined functions on Python as well. Here is the python code in the file called `make_data.py`. `train_test_RF()` takes some of the arguments for `make_regression()` as its arguments, split the data, train RF on the train data, evaluate the fit, and then return the test score.

```{python}
#| eval: false 
def train_test_RF(n_samples, n_features, n_informative, noise, rng):

  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
  import numpy as np
  
  X, y = make_regression(
    n_samples, 
    n_features, 
    n_informative = n_informative, 
    noise = noise, 
    random_state = rng
  )
  
  X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
      X, y, random_state = rng
  )

  reg_rf = RandomForestRegressor(max_features = "sqrt")

  reg_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

  test_score = reg_rf.score(X_test, y_test)

  return test_score
```

Sourcing this file using `source_python()`,

```{r}
source_python("run_rf.py")
```

Once this is done, `train_test_RF()` is now available to use on R. 

```{r}
train_test_RF(
  n_samples, 
  n_features, 
  n_informative = n_informative, 
  noise = noise, 
  rng = rng
)
```

## Python in Rmarkdown or Quarto

Using R and Python in an Rmarkdown or Quarto file is extremely easy. You can have both R and Python codes in the same Rmd file. When you write R (python) codes, you use R (python) code chunks indicated by `{R}` (`{python}`) like below.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("figures/reticulate_in_rmd.png")
```

First code chunk is an R code chunk and loads libraries including `reticulate`. 

:::{.callout-tip}
If you do not load the `reticulate` package, python code chunks still run, but the objects defined on python would not be available on R.
:::

The second code chunk is a python code chunk and generate synthetic data using `make_regression` from `sklearn.datasets`. 

The third code chunk is an R code chunk. It uses `X` and `y` generated on Python to train an RF using `ranger()`.
