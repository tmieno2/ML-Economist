  This book will provide an introduction to machine learning methods. The main target audience is economists (and possible other scientific fields that value causal identification). This was originally written for my students to enhance their productivity and their collaborative work with me. So, this book will by no means cover all the things that you would like to know. Rather, it covers a small subset of the vast world of machine learning methods that benefits my students and me. If you are still interested in reading the book. Suit yourself.
