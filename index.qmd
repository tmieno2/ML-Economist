  This book provides an introduction to machine learning methods for economists with particular focus on causal machine learning methods. It is still under development and it still has a long way to go before it is completed. One thing that may distinguish this book from the books on machine learning methods on the market is that it attempts to be illustrative and easy to understand for those who are not familiar with machine learning methods. This is done by providing step-by-step R codes to enhance understanding of various algorithms.
